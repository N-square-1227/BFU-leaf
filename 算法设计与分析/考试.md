Arithmetic Sequence (等差数列)

描述

An arithmetic sequence is a simple sequence, which is determined by the first item a1 and the common difference d. The formula (公式) of the sum of the n items of an arithmetic sequence is as follows:

Sn=a1*n+((n-1)*n*d)/2.

Given a1, d and n, your task is to calculate the sum Sn of the arithmetic sequence.



输入

The input begins with an integer T (1<=T<=100000), the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. For each test case,there are 3 integers representing a1,d, and n(1<=a1,d,n<=1000).



输出

For each test case, output an integer representing Sn.

String Matching

描述

Given a string S1 and another string S2. Your task is to determine the number of times that S2 appears in S1 (S2在S1中出现的次数).

输入



The input begins with an integer T (1<=T<=10), the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1<=n,m<=1000) — the length of S1 and the length of S2 respectively. The second line of each test case is S1 and the third line of each test case is S2.



输出



Output T lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case of the inputs.

Disjoint Set (并查集)

描述



There is an urgent message. Ming needs to send this message to all his classmates. Ming has all his classmates' phone numbers. Fortunately, if his classmate x has y's phone number and x receives this message, x will send this message to y. Now, Ming wants to know the minimum number of classmates he needs to notify so that everyone in the class can receive the message.



输入



The first line is an integer T (T<50), the number of the test cases. For each test case, the first line are two integers N and M (1<=N, M<=1000). N is the number of students in Ming's class, and M is the number of pairs. Then M lines follow. Each line contains two integers Xi and Yi, meaning that student Xi has Yi's phone number.



输出



For each test case, print the minimum number of classmates Ming needs to notify.

Piggy Bank (小猪存钱罐)

描述



KK has many piggy banks, each with some money in it. However, to use the money in the piggy banks, KK must break them. Today, KK needs to buy some items, and he wants to know the minimum number of piggy banks he needs to break if he wants to buy the ith item.



输入



The first line contains two integers n and q (1<=n,q<=100000), representing the number of piggy banks and the number of items respectively (分别地). The second line contains n integers, and the ith integer represents the amount of money Ai in the ith piggy bank (1<=Ai<=10^9). The third line contains q integers, and the ith integer represents the price of the ith item xi (1<=xi<=10^18).



输出



For the ith line, output an integer W representing the number of piggy banks that KK must break to buy the ith item.

Maze (迷宫)

描述



Isa is in a 4-direction maze (left, up, right, down). A maze consists of n*m grids, with each grid having the following types:

T: representing Isa can walk to this grid.

F: representing Isa cannot walk to this grid.

B: representing Isa's beginning position.

E: representing the exit of the maze.

If the grid's type is T and Isa walks from this gird to another, then the gird's type will change to F. Also, Isa cannot pass B and E twice. Now, Isa wants to know how many different ways she can get out of the maze.



输入



The first line contains two integers n and m (1<=n<=6,1<=m<=6). There are n more lines in the case, each of which includes m characters. Each character represents the type of a grid, that is, T, F, B or E.



输出



Output a number representing the number of different ways in which Isa can get out of the maze.

Beacon Tower (烽火台)

描述



A war begins, there are n beacon towers connected in a straight line. The ith tower is located at axis (轴线) i, with Ai monitoring range (监视范围), that is, the ith tower's monitoring range is [max(0,i-Ai), i]. A tower will light its beacon if there are enemies in its monitoring range or if the soldier in it sees another tower's beacon is lit. However, lighting a beacon needs time, and the time for each tower's soldier to light the beacon may not be the same. The time for the ith tower's soldier to light the beacon is Ti. General W, the commander (指挥官W将军), wants to know how long it will take for each tower to light its beacon if there are enemies at axis 0.



输入



The first line contains an integer n (1<=n<=100000) — the number of beacon towers.

The second line contains n integers, and the ith integer is Ti (1<=Ti<=10^9).

The third line contains n integers, and the ith integer is Ai ( 1<=Ai<=10).



输出



Output n lines. The ith line contains a number representing the ith tower's light time.
